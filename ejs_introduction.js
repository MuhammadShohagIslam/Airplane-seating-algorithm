    *** EJS(Embedded JavaScript) ***
        => EJS is a simple templating language which lets we
        generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript

        *** There are some benefits of EJS
            => We can use plain JavaScript
            => Fast Development time
            => We can get comfortable beacuse it is simple syntax
            => It's easy to debugging

        *** Some important Tags ***
                <% : Scriptlet tag for control-flow, no output
                <%= : Outputs the value into the template(HTML escaped)
                <%- : Outputs the unescaped value into the template
                <%# : Comments tag, no execution, no output
                -%>: Trim-mode ('newline slurp') tag, trims following newline

        *** Includes ***
            => If we want to includes are relative to the template, we can use it.
